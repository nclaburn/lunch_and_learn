Distributed Version Control Lunch & Learn
=========================

I wanted to send out the resources for the Distributed Version Control (DVC) talk a couple of days before hand.  Most of the material I cover comes from these books, blog posts, videos, and screen casts. In addition Iâ€™ll add my opinion based on personal experience. 

I've used both Mercurial and Git in "production" and liked both. Currently my preferences lean more torward Git therefore most of the references in my talk and here will be git based.
